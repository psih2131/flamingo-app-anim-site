    faq : "Frequently Asked Questions",
    faq_short : "FAQ",
    faq_text : "Find quick answers to common questions about using the Flamingo app.",
    faq_q1 : 'Why do I need to set Location Services to "Always"?',
    faq_q2 : "Why do I have to open the app every month?",
    faq_q3 : "Can you see my precise location at any given time?",
    faq_q4 : "Can I add my past travel history from before I installed the app?",
    faq_q5 : "Can I use Flamingo for free?",
    faq_q6 : "Can I track my travel to individual UK countries (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland) separately from the UK?",
    faq_q7 : "Do you have an Android version?",

    faq_a1:  'For accurate automatic travel tracking, it\'s essential to set Location Services to "Always" instead of "While Using the App." This ensures Flamingo can track your movements in the background, even when the app is closed, eliminating the need to open the app each time you cross a country or state border. Rest assured, extensive testing has been conducted to ensure minimal battery usage with this location setting.',
    faq_a2:  'We recommend opening the app approximately every month, as the iPhone operating system may block an app’s tracking feature due to inactivity. Regularly opening Flamingo ensures continuous and accurate travel tracking without interruption.',
    faq_a3:  'Rest assured, all data entered or automatically recorded in the app is encrypted by Apple and stored solely on your device or Apple\'s secure data services (iCloud), depending on your app settings. We do not have access nor store your data on our servers and that is why we do not require registration in the app. Moreover, Flamingo never tracks your precise location. Instead, we use city-level geolocation to determine your general location for the purpose of recording your movements between countries, US states and cities. This approach ensures complete privacy for you and barely has any impact on your battery power. ',
    faq_a4:  'Yes, you can add your past travel information to the app. There are two ways to do this: manually add each trip to your timeline one-by-one, or if you usually take many photos, you can automatically reconstruct your travel history by scanning your Photo Library. We do not upload or see any of your photos; we only scan their location and timestamp information, so the scanning process takes just a few minutes.',
    faq_a5:  "As a free user of the Flamingo app, you are allowed to enter up to five travel entries. This includes both manually entered trips (completed trips) and automatically tracked trips (new trips). Once you reach this limit, you will need to either delete some of the existing entries to add new ones or consider upgrading to a paid subscription for unlimited trip tracking and report feature.",
    faq_a6:  "Yes, you have the option to track individual UK countries (England, Scotland, etc.) separately or combine them and record all visits as the UK. Additionally, you can track your visits to the islands of Jersey and Guernsey separately from mainland UK.",
    faq_a7:  "The Flamingo app is not yet available on Android, but we are actively working on its development. Stay tuned for updates!",
